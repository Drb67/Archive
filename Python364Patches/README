See the edits of Final.diff

Patch Final.diff and use setup.diff (as a example) to compile modules. 
Run autoconf

./configure --host=aarch64-apple-darwin17 --build=<YOUR-HOST-OS-TRIPLE> <ARGS>
/* A config file from python has the configure args for the electra compile I did. /*

After running the configure script with the Final2.patch:
Edit ./config.status and make sure you don't have -undefined dynamic_lookup in any of your flags (or something along those lines.
Run ./config.status
/* I tried to patch it out, but got lazy when the changes failed the first time. /*

Other files are just aids I used (and otherwise have no use).

This is just a simple build, no changes to the code (.h, .c, etc.) were made.
I had to edit _scproxy out of a python script for pip, iOS doesn't support it.
HEY! I think removing MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET from getting set, will fix pip.
