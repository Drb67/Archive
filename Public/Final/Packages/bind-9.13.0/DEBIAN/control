	the standard DNS server used by millions
	dig, host, and nslookup come from this package.
	** Notes for dig, host, and nslookup.
	We don't have a listner on port 53 (DNS)
	Dirty DNS server:
	'ncat --sh-exec "ncat -u 8.8.8.8 53" -ul 53 --keep-open &'
	Requries netcat from the nmap package, GNU netcat doesn't have --sh-exec.
	Or, putting "@8.8.8.8" in your args may work. '8.8.8.8' is Google's DNS Server
	** Other Notes
	Other programs are not tested, PM if you find it working.
