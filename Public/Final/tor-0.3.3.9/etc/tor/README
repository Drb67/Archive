Basic off the works of Wizardry and Steamworks.

Just trying to stay out of trouble for copying pasting their solution for a launchdaemon/launch script.
	(I know, I'm still a idiot for thinking copying the copyright makes it fine. Then again, It's GPL and I didn't make changes to the source code of TOR. Still doesn't make it fine without permission personally.) 

Used files from their package of tor:
tor-tsocks.conf
torrc
proxy.pac
Launchdaemon - CHANGED ID TO AVOID CONFLICT
Setting Panel - CHANGED ID TO AVOID CONFLICT


Due to dependency of plutil (SamBingner's repo has it, but not a default repo) I don't think a launchdaemon is a good idea.
You could just type this in a new prompt:
`su nobody -s /bin/sh -c "/usr/local/bin/tor --defaults-torrc --hush" & exit` 


Change '127.0.0.1' to '0.0.0.0' If you want other devices to be able to connect to the SOCK proxy.
