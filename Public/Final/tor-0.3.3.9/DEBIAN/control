	Repeat after me:
	TOR IS ONLY SECURE IF CONFIGURED RIGHT.
	It's up to you to configure Tor right.
	~ 
	Do NOT do something stupid and try to be a l33t hacker.
	This should only be used in cases of firewall bypassing, not evil.
	If you really need to bypass a firewall, look into ShadowSocks.

	Update:
	Stole WAS's LaunchDaemon and Setting's Panel.
	Credits goes to them.
