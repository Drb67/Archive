	I messed up badly and I'm sorry.
	Hopefully the postinst fixes this.
	What happen was that I symlinked files from /usr/local/lib to /usr/lib, 
	I overwrote the cache and pointed zlib to a real file. (Breaking Apps)
	And when you removed the package, 
	dpkg would've removed the symlinks to the cache; (Removing wouldn't fix it)
	Screwing anyone that installed this package.
	Please install this as soon as possible, I'm sorry for screwing up so badly.
